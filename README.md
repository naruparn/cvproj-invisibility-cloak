## **Invisibility Cloak**
Project idea: https://harshilp.medium.com/invisibility-cloak-using-opencv-8b07142c83d6

This simple project aims to imitate the effects of invisibility cloak (like in Harry Potter). The technique that will be used is opposite to the Green Screening. In green screening, we remove background but here we will remove the foreground frame.
